## Overview:
the illustrate project is meant to give the tools necessary to paint a picture of the cryptocurrency scene. This involves coin prices, coin history, NFTS, ENS data, and more, all in a graphical representation.

illustrate's flagship discord bot is a minimalistic, open source Discord bot that serves as a customizable engine for server-owners and crypto enthusiasts. illustrateâ€™s UI and setup process is easy to follow, and visually appealing as a personal or public analytics platform. With scaling in mind, the bot comes bundled with a sqlite database wrapper for higher production means, and can support dozens of servers at once. Any webhooks in a server that illustrate has access to can be linked to a type of analytic for an easy-access and plug & play setup.

## Features:
* Bitcoin Price
* Ethereum Price
* ~Ethereum Gas~ (discontinued as of July 2023 due to provider shutdown)
* Edit update interval for all data, which runs asyncronously
